## Overview of Content

This repository contains a series of supplemental notebooks used in XXX.

The course made use of Dorfman and Daotidis's "Numerical Methods and Chemical Engineering Applications" as a primary textbook. A list of the chapters of Dorfman and Daotidis which correspond to each tutorial is provided below. We should however note that the enclosed material was design to be used in a stand alone fashion and may be readily integrated into other courses.

- Tutorial \#0 (Introduction to Matlab/Julia) - N/A
- Tutorial \#1 (Linear Algebraic Systems) - Chapter 2
- Tutorial \#2 (Nonlinear Algebraic Systems) - Chapter 3
- Tutorial \#3 (ODEs, Initial Value Problems) - Chapter 4
- Tutorial \#4 (ODEs, Boundary Value Problems) - Chapter 6
- Tutorial \#5 (Partial Differential Equations) - Chapter 7
- Tutorial \#6 (Optimization) - N/A
