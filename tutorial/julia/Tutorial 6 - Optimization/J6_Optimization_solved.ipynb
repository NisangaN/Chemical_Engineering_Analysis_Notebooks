    "Optimizers generally exploit a specific mathematical structure in the problem formulation as a means to solve a problem. In fact, some underlying assumptions are always required to ensure a problem is optimized. One common example arrise from combining KKT conditions with constraint qualifications or alternatively regularity conditions for nonlinear programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problem types range from linear programs for which problems with 100k variables and constraints may routinely be solved [in less than a minute](http://plato.asu.edu/ftp/lpsimp.html) to continuous convex problems to nonconvex nonlinear mixed-integer problems (were some problems with fewer than 5 variables have yet to be solved). As such, using an appropriate optimizer for a particular problem type can transform an unsolveable problem into a trival one. The most heavily studied and widely used descriptors for each program are linear, quadratic, nonlinear, and mixed-integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of based on objectives/constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear:** All the constraints and the objective are linear.\n",
    "- **Quadratic** all the constraints and the objective are quadratic or linear.\n",
    "- **Nonlinear** at least one constraint or the objective is not linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types based on manner of variable used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous:** All variables can vary between values in some possibly open interval.\n",

    "- **Mixed-integer:** The problem contains both integer and continuous variables.\n",

    "One of the central focuses of optimization research has focused on developing specialized routines for solving programs with other special forms. A number of other important forms include [specially-ordered sets](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01589393), [second-order cones](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6983691), [equilibrium constraints](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~lchrist/Ferris_mathematical_programs2.pdf), as well as a myriad of special nonlinear forms. When attempting to solve a difficult model it's worth checking a few references (such as [Mosek's Modeling Cookbook](https://docs.mosek.com/MOSEKModelingCookbook-letter.pdf)) to see if the problem can be re-written as simplier form or a simplier problem type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend has lead to the development of a number of specialized languages and software packages used to describe optimization problems interface with a myriad of different optimizers. In Python, the main tools for this are [Pyomo]() and [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/). In Julia, we have [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/), and [Convex.jl](https://jump.dev/Convex.jl/stable/). A number of other commercial offerings available include [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/), [AIMMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIMMS), and [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) along with a number of offerings associated with commercially available solvers such as [CPLEX Optimization Studio by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) or [Xpress Mosel for FICO Express](https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization). We'll work through formulating and solving a couple of optimization problems using JuMP in this workbook.\n",

    "The efficient utilitization of water will be an integral part to solving the numerous water management issues of today and the near future. Increasing usage of water, anticipated water scarities, and changing regulations are expected to result in numerous related challenges in the next  decades. These challenges may extend to the adaptation of numerous industrial processes. as fresh water is a key resource in such processes.  These include washing operations in the food processing, thermal processing (cooling, quenching, and scrubbing) in iron and steel  manufacturing, and the desalination of crude oil. In each of this  processes, some level of contamination is introduced into the freshwater by the process. This process water is then treated in a central  facility to remove contaminants and satisfy local regulatory specifications for the disposal of wastewater. In design or improvement of these central facilities, three key questions must be considered. 1) What unit operations need to be included? 2) How should these process units  be connected? 3) How should one operate these processes units?\n",

    "A typical design objective for a wastewater treatment plant may be to minimize it's overall cost in a given year of operation. That is we minimize the sum of the cost fo freshwater intake, the investment cost associated with each treatment unit, and the operating cost of  each unit. This can be achieved by minimizing the follow objective:\n",

    "Two contaminants A & B are introduced into the system and the concentration of each contaminant must be reduced to 10ppm prior to discharging it into the enviroment. The cost of freshwater is assumed to be $1/ton, the annualized factor for investment on the treatment unit is taken to be 0.1, and the total time of operation of the plant is 8000h/year. While numerous different treatment technologies and separation train configurations are possible, we've settled on using two distinct units to perform a primary and secondary treatment. We'd like to determine whether the inclusion of a recycle stream(s) may reduce the process cost and whether is preferable to have the recyle stream bridge one unit or two.\n",

    "We've now started to define objective and constraint functions which compute the concentration and flow rates associated with each stream and the overall system cost. Generally, there are two approaches to doing this. We can introduce a new variable for each concentration and flowrate and allow the optimizer to enforce mass balances. Alternative, we can algebraiclly re-arrange these mass balances and avoid introducing a large number of variables. In some cases, the former approach exposes special forms that an optimizer may use effectively. In other cases, the decreased number of variables may be more beneficial. We primarily use the later approach but we'll introduce variables to handle the recycle-loops which generally cannot be re-arranged into an explicit algebraic form. The optimization variables are $x=\\left(F_{\\mathrm{feed}} ,F_2 ,F_9 ,C_{A,4} ,C_{B,4} ,C_{A,9} ,C_{B,9} ,F_6 ,C_{A,8} ,C_{B,8} \\right)$. Take some time to inspect the constraint function and reflect on the choice of these variables.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Generally optimizers require that all variables have both lower (lb) and upper (ub) bounds defined. If there aren't any obvious choices in a problem, you may have to exercise your best judgement and choose reasonable bounds. Equipment based bounds on flowrate are provided below. Further, we assume 0.1 is a sufficiently high concetration such that it will be an inactive constraint. Furthermore, an initial guess (x0) often must be specified. For convex problems, the solution obtained will generally not depend on this guess. \n",

    "We've solved two optimization problems: an integer program and a  nonlinear program. The full design of a wastewater treatment plant may  be handled by combining these two approaches. This can include which  process units, how many process units, and treatment units are included  as well as a full exploration of recycle loop configurations. This  variety of problem is termed superstructure optimization and developing efficient means of solving these problems remains an active area of research. How might we modify the above problem using 0-1 integer variables to explore other potential recycle configurations?\n",
