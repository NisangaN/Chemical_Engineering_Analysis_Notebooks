    "# Simulating a graded catalyst bed\n",
    "\n",
    "Process engineers are often engaged in tasks centered around increasing the economic productivity of process equipment while ensuring safe operation. For the commodity chemical industry, increased conversion of reactant to product remains a desired outcome. One of the most common used continuously operating reactor in this sector is that of the catalytic packed bed reactor. In this configuration, a tubular reactor is employed. This tube is packed with catalyst covered particles and the reactant flows over the catalyst bed. In many cases, a large number of tubes will be used in parallel cooled by the same jacket. We'll just consider the single tube variant here. A simplifed depiction is given below. \n",

    "The reactor is typically operated such at a hotspot occurs in the reactor, the reactor is stable (and in turn safe), and a high degree of selectivity and conversion is achieved. A number of process parameters including pressure, temperature, residence time, cooling rate, and feed composition may be manipulated to improve reactor productivity, selectivity, conversion, or overall profitability. We'll build a simulation (based on the model in this [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie4005699).) to investigate the how using a graded catalyst may impact reactor performance. That is to say a reactor in which differing zones are loaded with catalyst of differing activity levels. This can allow the operator to raise the effective reactor temperature while preventing thermal runaway and maintaining adequate selectivity.\n",
