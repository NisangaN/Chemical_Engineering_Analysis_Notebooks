    "- For IVP-PDEs, the problem size can grow quite rapidly. For a 3D systems, using 20 discretization points in each dimension leads to an 8000-by-8000 system while 256 points leads to a ~16 million by ~16 million system. As illustrated by [Jaroudi, et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207160.2019.1613526?af=R), a large number of such systems can be solved in a few hours on standard desktop. In light of this fact, how do you think the resulting linear systems formulated and solved?"
