This reactor is backed with a catalystic particles and the reactant flows over the catalyst bed. Depending on the nature of the reaction (endothermic vs. exothermic) several different regions of cooling jackets or heating elements may be used to maintian a desired temperature profile. Moreover, the reaction rate may also be modulated by changing the dis.\n",

For a 3D systems, using 20 discretization points in each dimension leads to an 8000-by-8000 system while 256 points leads to a ~16 million by ~16 million system. As illustrated by [Jaroudi, et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207160.2019.1613526?af=R), a large number of such systems can be solved in a few hours on standard desktop.
