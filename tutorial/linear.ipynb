That is if we can perform valid operators that reduce the matrix A to the identity matrix then the corresponding right-hand side will be the solution x*\n",

    "A coating consists of a ~75% of a functional polymer mix (resin forms a solid matrix to hold pigments in place, an extender which provides adhesion to the surface, a solvent which allows the coating to be applied, and a series of additives). Common additives include bactericides, fungicides, algaecides, disperants, anti-frictive agents, and/or thixotropic agents. Three pigments (Titanium Oxide - White, ) are added to the blend in amounts 5 - 20% is used ot "
